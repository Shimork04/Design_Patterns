## Features

- User creation and management.
- Payment processing using different methods (Credit Card, UPI).
- Transaction logging for tracking and auditing.
- Real-time notifications for payment events.
- Implementation of multiple software design patterns.

## Design Patterns

This application utilizes the following design patterns:

### Creational Patterns
1. **Factory Pattern**: 
   - **UserFactory**: Creates `User` objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
   - **PaymentFactory**: Creates `Payment` objects based on the selected payment method.

### Behavioral Patterns
2. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - **PaymentStrategy**: Defines a strategy for processing payments, allowing dynamic selection of payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, UPI) at runtime.
3. **Observer Pattern**:
   - **PaymentObserver**: Notifies subscribers about payment events, allowing for real-time updates on payment processing.

### Structural Patterns
4. **Decorator Pattern**:
   - **TransactionLogger**: Enhances the payment processing functionality by logging transactions, providing a way to add behavior to payment processing objects dynamically.

5. **Context Pattern**:
   - **PaymentContext**: Maintains a reference to the current payment strategy, allowing the application to execute payment processing through a unified interface.

6. **Composite Pattern**:
   - **Payment**: Serves as an abstract base class for different payment methods, allowing clients to treat individual payment objects and compositions uniformly.
